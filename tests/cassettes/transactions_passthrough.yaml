        Reed''s adult anti-trans legislative risk assessment map on or before December
        31, 2025. Resolves as \"No\" for all other states on January 1, 2026.</p><p>Context:
        Anti-trans legislation has become epidemic in the United States over the past
        several years, especially at the state level (though federal anti-trans policies
        are also likely under the upcoming administration.) Erin Reed (<a target=\"_blank\"
        rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" class=\"text-primary break-all\" href=\"https://www.erininthemorning.com/\">https://www.erininthemorning.com/</a>)
        maintains a map showing which states are the most risky for trans people.
        The highest possible risk level is \"Do Not Travel\", currently (as of November
        2024) only obtained by Texas and Florida. Ten other states are at the second-highest
        risk level; these ten states are the first ones I added to the list. The public
        may add other states to the list if they believe that other states also pose
        a particularly high risk.<br><br>Receiving a \"Do Not Travel\" rating once
        is sufficient for a state to resolve as \"Yes\", even if that rating is later
        upgraded out of \"Do Not Travel\" status.<br><br>In the event that Erin Reed''s
        website is shut down, e.g. by federal censorship, the questions for all states

        Anti-trans legislation has become epidemic in the United States over the past
        several years, especially at the state level (though federal anti-trans policies
        are also likely under the upcoming administration.) Erin Reed (<a target=\"_blank\"

        maintains a map showing which states are the most risky for trans people.
        The highest possible risk level is \"Do Not Travel\", currently (as of November
        2024) only obtained by Texas and Florida. Ten other states are at the second-highest
        risk level; these ten states are the first ones I added to the list. The public
        may add other states to the list if they believe that other states also pose
        a particularly high risk.<br><br>Receiving a \"Do Not Travel\" rating once
        is sufficient for a state to resolve as \"Yes\", even if that rating is later
        upgraded out of \"Do Not Travel\" status.<br><br>In the event that Erin Reed''s

        Reed''s adult anti-trans legislative risk assessment map on or before December
        31, 2025. Resolves as \"No\" for all other states on January 1, 2026.</p><p>Context:
        Anti-trans legislation has become epidemic in the United States over the past
        several years, especially at the state level (though federal anti-trans policies
        are also likely under the upcoming administration.) Erin Reed (<a target=\"_blank\"
        rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" class=\"text-primary break-all\" href=\"https://www.erininthemorning.com/\">https://www.erininthemorning.com/</a>)
        maintains a map showing which states are the most risky for trans people.
        The highest possible risk level is \"Do Not Travel\", currently (as of November
        2024) only obtained by Texas and Florida. Ten other states are at the second-highest
        risk level; these ten states are the first ones I added to the list. The public
        may add other states to the list if they believe that other states also pose
        a particularly high risk.<br><br>Receiving a \"Do Not Travel\" rating once
        is sufficient for a state to resolve as \"Yes\", even if that rating is later
        upgraded out of \"Do Not Travel\" status.<br><br>In the event that Erin Reed''s
        website is shut down, e.g. by federal censorship, the questions for all states

        Anti-trans legislation has become epidemic in the United States over the past
        several years, especially at the state level (though federal anti-trans policies
        are also likely under the upcoming administration.) Erin Reed (<a target=\"_blank\"

        maintains a map showing which states are the most risky for trans people.
        The highest possible risk level is \"Do Not Travel\", currently (as of November
        2024) only obtained by Texas and Florida. Ten other states are at the second-highest
        risk level; these ten states are the first ones I added to the list. The public
        may add other states to the list if they believe that other states also pose
        a particularly high risk.<br><br>Receiving a \"Do Not Travel\" rating once
        is sufficient for a state to resolve as \"Yes\", even if that rating is later
        upgraded out of \"Do Not Travel\" status.<br><br>In the event that Erin Reed''s
